# Node_Mongo_APIs_JSON_Site
Static site that is rendered conditionally from a Json file and dynamically updated upon data change in the Json file. 
This goes to show how one can use Node.js to serve a JSon file that can instead be used to make an extremely efficient static file that is served locally after after initial loading from a backend/database.
